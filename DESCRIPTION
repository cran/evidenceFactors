Description: Provides tools for integrated sensitivity analysis of evidence factors in observational
	studies. When an observational study allows for multiple independent or nearly
	independent inferences which, if vulnerable, are vulnerable to different biases, we have 
	multiple evidence factors.  This package provides methods that respect type I error rate control. 
	Examples are provided of integrated evidence factors analysis in a longitudinal study with
	continuous outcome and in a case-control study.
